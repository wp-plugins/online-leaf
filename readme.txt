Integrates a standby engine to reduce the energy required to view the website when the visitors are inactive, to make your blog a Green Website.

== Description ==

Because Internet browsing consumes a lot of energy on a global level, [Online Leaf](http://www.onlineleaf.com/ "Online Leaf") develops methods to reduce the amount of energy required to browse the internet, by making websites greener.

= The plugin =

This plugin enables your blog to install a green standby engine on your blog. The engine will automatically activate a dark screen when your visitors are inactive, which darkens the colors and hides animations and effects, so that the monitors do not waste energy generating those and simply because dark colors, on many monitors, require less energy to display than brighter ones.

= The goal =

Online Leaf aims to reduce the overall CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from displaying websites, without any loss of visitor experience. You can still use visual effects, animations and heavy graphics to improve your website's overall quality, since the standby engine does not conflict with any of those (as it is only activated when your visitors are inactive). The only change is that your blog will be a [Green Website](http://www.onlineleaf.com/Green-Websites/ "Green Website") and help in making the web a much greener place to surf.

= CO2 neutralized =

The usage of Online Leaf is CO<sub>2</sub> neutralized, by acquiring CO<sub>2</sub> quotas, which are cleared with the state authorities in EU.
Please read more about [CO2 neutralized websites](http://www.co2neutralwebsite.com/?utm_source=onlineleaf_01&utm_medium=onlineleaf_01&utm_campaign=onlineleaf_01 "CO2 neutralized websites") if you are interested.
